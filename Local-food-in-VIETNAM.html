The coffee was served in small metal Vietnamese drip filters known locally as Ca Phe Phin where the freshly grounded coffee is contained inside, then they poured the hot water into the device and covered it. The filtering processes can take up to five minutes before it is ready to be consumed. We advise everyone to have this coffee when you are in Vietnam next time. </p>

                <p>For every traveler traveling to Vietnam, you must try the taste of Vietnamese dishes. Vietnam is famous for its local cuisine, but the country also boasts of an excellent Indian restaurant. However, if you have a craving for Indian cuisine, then try our suggested Indian restaurant, Baba’s Kitchen in Vietnam. They serve authentic Indian dishes like tandoori chicken, chicken tikka masala, butter chicken, palak paneer, and kheer, known as pudding. They offer you kheer free of costs at the end of the meal, which is very authentic and delicious to eat.</p>
